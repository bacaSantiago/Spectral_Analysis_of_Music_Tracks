# Spectral_Analysis_of_Music_Tracks
This program performs a spectral analysis of two songs, "Ser√° Que No Me Amas" by Luis Miguel and "Blame It On the Boogie" by The Jacksons, aiming to objectively compare their audio components. The analysis focuses on a specific time frame (from 3 to 6 seconds) and utilizes the Fourier Transform to examine frequency magnitudes.
